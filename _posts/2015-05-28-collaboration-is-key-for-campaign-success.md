We have recently been hard at work promoting the upcoming South of England Show with the South of England Agricultural Society (SEAS). So far, online ticket sales are up 350% from last year, so we must be doing something right.

As the campaign has taken shape we have really noticed how the key to success has been close collaboration with the SEAS in-house team.

Relationships between in-house marketing teams (even if it’s a one-person team!) can sometimes get hectic when everyone is busy, but it’s so important to retain open and clear communication channels so that both client and agency can deliver to the highest standard in their respective roles.

Agencies should invite their clients to offer their insight and ideas; their input is invaluable as, after all, they know their business best. This can often really help clarify expectations and when they feel more comfortable sharing with you, can provide much more detailed briefs.

Having previously been on the client, I know it doesn’t feel nice when you’re not sure what’s happening, as it’s happening, and feeling like you have no control or your opinions aren’t valued.

Our recent experience with SEAS has resulted in great work, a happy client and a happy agency. Collaborating with them closely has truly made it feel like everyone’s success when the numbers come in.

Client insight and agency expertise is a potent combination – it has often resulted in the most innovative and successful projects that we have done with our clients.

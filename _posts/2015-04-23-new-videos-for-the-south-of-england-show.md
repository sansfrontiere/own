Summer time is fast upon and that means... we're getting ready for the South of England Show! We've just put up these fab new videos that highlight how wonderful the show is.

We were also thrilled to get the news today that online ticket sales are up 350% from last year! We've been working with the South of England Agricultural Society on an Earlybird tickets campaign and getting the word out online through social media and digital advertising - and it seems to be working!

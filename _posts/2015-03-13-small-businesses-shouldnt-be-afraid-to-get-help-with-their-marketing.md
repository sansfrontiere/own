Due to time and budget constraints, small businesses often overlook the significance of marketing. Here’s why we think you shouldn’t, especially now that the government has launched the Growth Vouchers programme.

<b>Why ask for marketing advice?</b>

A marketing plan helps make sense of your business environment – understanding your customers, your competitors, how to operate, and sell your product and services effectively. In today’s crowded marketplace how you position your brand and communicate, and on what platforms, is critical to success.

Too often, marketing is overlooked or left to someone who has little marketing experience. Increasingly, operations need to be lean and efficient, particularly for starts ups and small businesses. However, considering marketing as an area that does not merit investment can be detrimental. You wouldn’t leave your accounting to someone with no finance experience (we hope!).

Time and time again we have been approached by businesses that have realised they need a marketing intervention. Often, they have spent time and money inefficiently trying to do their marketing themselves with little knowledge or experience. Often, they realise that they need to backtrack and start from scratch, clarifying what it is that they want to achieve. Marketers can help you realise your goals without the pain of trying to struggle through it on your own, optimising your investment.

Effective marketing isn’t achieved through ad hoc actions or a cowboy approach. There’s deep thought and well-researched planning that backs up a smart strategy or successful campaign. Hopefully, this shouldn’t come as a surprise, as it pertains to every other area of running a business.

<b>How can we help?</b>

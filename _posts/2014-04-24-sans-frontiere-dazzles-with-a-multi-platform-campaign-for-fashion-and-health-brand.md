When Eyesite asked us to promote their new range of sunglasses to existing customers, Sans Frontiere Marketing knew a multimedia campaign would hit the mark in terms of both impact and budget. Our marketing strategists have used their strong experience of direct mail, email communication, retail display and social media to reach a wide demographic audience with high style values.

Our design team began by brainstorming ideas for a creative piece of direct mail that would prove virtually irresistible when it landed on customers’ doormats. The winning idea was to create a wallet that emulates a leather sunglasses case which opens to reveal an 8-sided DL flyer showing a range of fabulous sunglasses for men and women.

Our creative director developed the visual to feature a map of the world with a spotlight on seven sunny, glamorous destinations and images of selected stunning frames. The call to action invites customers to pop into their Eyesite branch to try on as many frames as they like and, importantly, to book an eye test if needed.

To reflect the high value of the products we are promoting for Eyesite, this two-piece multi-folded item needed to be a superior quality item and thanks to Sans Frontiere’s experience of print buying and long-standing relationships with our suppliers, we were able to deliver an excellent product at an affordable price. We also designed a bespoke envelope and accompanying letter.

The creative concept was developed by our digital studio to create an email that also contains a link to Gucci’s promotional You Tube video so that customers can see the frames in more detail. We created four versions of the eshot tailored for each of the four branches with an inviting subject line that was personalised to their location.

To spread the message to the wider communities of the four Eyesite practices, Sans Frontiere’s PR department delivered pitches to the regional newspapers and magazines showing tempting high res images of selected sunglasses that would make perfect content for features on spring and summer fashion &amp; accessories. Through our established network of contacts with our media targets, editors’ interest was piqued and coverage is set to roll in.

New customers will also be attracted to come in-store by the dazzling poster designs for A-boards that now command attention in the shopping districts of Brighton, Reading, Winchester and Oxford.

By the nature of the work, installers are usually away from desktop computers and on their mobiles. By not having a mobile optimised site, you will be missing out on your key customers, how they access your site and ultimately, sales.

<strong>Common mistakes for websites on mobile</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The text is too small so users can’t read the website without zooming in. Desktop sites are being squashed into a mobile screens.</li>
 	<li>Calls to action and buttons are in the wrong place or too small, so users can't move around your website and make purchases.</li>
 	<li>Your company phone number or address is not prominent enough; users on mobile usually need this information so they can get in touch quickly.</li>
</ul>
If your website is making these mistakes <a href="mailto:jason@sansfrontiere.co.uk">get in touch</a> and we can review your website.

<strong>What are the causes of mobile user increase?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Social media has been a huge driver; 90% of Facebook’s daily active users access it via mobile and users are clicking links to your website.</li>
 	<li>Email data tell a similar story; 54% of emails are now opened on mobile so customers are clicking to your website on their mobile.</li>
 	<li>People are searching differently; Google announced last year that there are more searches on mobile than tablet and desktop combined</li>
</ul>

<strong>What does that mean for your existing website in the installer market?</strong>

Quite simply, you could be missing out on sales and revenue. Some web managers argue that installers do not purchase via mobile, but installers will definitely be researching your products and services to make a purchase later. If your website does not supply this product information easily then you may be negatively impacting your sales. An update last year by Google resulted in non-mobile websites falling down search results ranking, so your company website will be harder to find by your customers and competitors will be displayed instead.

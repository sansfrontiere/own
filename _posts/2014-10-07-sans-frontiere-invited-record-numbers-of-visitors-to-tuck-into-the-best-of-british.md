To promote the three glorious days of the 2014 South of England Show, Sans Frontiere delivered a basket of goodies encouraging visitors to “Tuck into the Best of British Countryside” and enjoy the best of British agriculture, equestrianism, horticulture, food and drink, country crafts, sports and many other activities.

Our creative was rolled out across press, radio, TV, online and social media and attracted over 70,000 people to the Showground, a record number of visitors to the region’s largest event of its kind.

Plans for the Autumn Show &amp; Game Fair on 4th &amp; 5th October are now underway and we look forward to delivering a similarly successful campaign.

The Autumn Show &amp; Game Fair is a great day out for fans of hunting, shooting and fishing, with lots of attractions to entertain the whole family.

<h3>Email marketing is considered to have the largest captive audience of any marketing technique and allowing for very cost effective communication. It can help you to generate new business leads, keep in touch with your existing client base to aid customer retention and be used for upsell opportunities.</h3>
Sans Frontiere creates eshots with impactful design, great copy and outstanding deliverability. We run your campaign through popular spam filters at the desktop, server and firewall level before we send it on your behalf.

One of the distinct benefits of email marketing is that it creates a large amount of data for you to analyse, allowing you to target your marketing campaigns in a much more specific manner. We will analyse the data of your email marketing campaigns, and providing you with detailed statistics on open rates, click-through rates, forwards and links. By growing your opt-in email database, and then segment that into customer groups our precise targeting means you are delivering client-optimised results more likely to generate results.

Email marketing provides you with a marketing technique that allows you to immediately contact your audience, and see a return in investment for your business. Whether small or large, email offers an immediately beneficial approach to building your business.

<h3>At Sans Frontiere, we work closely with our clients to devise and implement a strategic approach to PR that really works.</h3>
<strong>PR</strong>
With our full press office service, we secure meaningful coverage in print and online in national, local, regional and specialist trade publications, and on radio. These can take the form of editorials, features, reports, case studies, news items, opinion pieces and advertorials.

We also ensure that communication is spread across all media to help raise awareness of our clients' brands. Our Social Media team produces online company blogs, video blogs and podcasts which can help to build your presence on social networks such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.

<strong>Media Planning</strong>
With over 15 years of experience in advertising and media planning, our team of strategists, creatives and writers can create impactful advertising campaigns across print, broadcast, outdoor, point-of-sale and online media.

We pull out all the stops to understand your needs, your target audience and your message. Our creative team and copywriters work together to produce a winning combination of eye-catching designs and compelling copy that best sells your brand and message. Our expertise lies in the way we are able to devise strategies for clients across all media.
